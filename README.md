Introduction to Quantum Computing Workshop

This is the Beta version of a Workshop to step participants through
running their first program on a quantum computer.  In this workshop,
we will:

   1) Create a gBraid account (if needed).
   2) Lauch qBraid from this GitHub repository
   3) Log on to IBM's Quantum Cloud
   4) Load the runtime Jupyter lab, and configure the Qiskit Runtime
   5) Load HelloBell Jupyter lab and run a simple measurement of a Bell state
   6) Run the same program, but with unentangled qubits
   7) Discuss and compare results

For those interested, and time permitting, instructions for a local installation
of Python (miniconda), and Qiskit are provided.
